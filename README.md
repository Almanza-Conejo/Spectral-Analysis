# Spectral-Analysis
This is a Spectral Analysis (SA) repository with some differents proyects that I'd developed.

Here you can find some proyect with respect to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Spectral
Analysis (SA). The SA is the area that studies the behavior of a signal when transforming it
to another domain, most commonly the frequency domain. 

Here you can find programming codes, developed in MATLAB code, for the transformation of a
signal to the frequency domain or scale. As well as codes to extract the graphical
representation of a signal in the frequency domain. One of the most used techniques is
the spectrogram.
